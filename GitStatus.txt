Here I have learned new thing in Git

It's Regarding git status 

Create any folder
>Git init
>Add two files in this and add it and commit

Create new file and do
>touch file2.txt

>git status - it will give file2.txt untracked

>git status -s : will give you the same
AS ??file2.txt

>git add file2.txt

>git status -s : will give you the same
A file2.txt
:it is tracked by git and it is in staging area

Now Add something in that file 
>echo something > file2.txt

See the content
>cat file2.txt

>git status -s : will give you the same
AM file2.txt


it will hows you that file added but change happend in this file and tha is not commited yet.
